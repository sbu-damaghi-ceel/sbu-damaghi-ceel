### Project 1: Ecology and Evolution of Breast Carcinogenesis
- **Aim 1:** Investigate how microenvironmental selection influences the phenotypic switch in early breast cancer. Single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell ATAC sequencing will be employed to correlate phenotypes with mutation signatures.
- **Aim 2:** Utilize novel single-cell barcoding techniques to track clonal dynamics and correlate these with genotypic and phenotypic adaptations.
- **Aim 3:** Uncover the mechanisms behind metabolic reprogramming in early breast cancer cells.
