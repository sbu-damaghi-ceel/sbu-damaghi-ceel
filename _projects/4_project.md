### Project 4: Evolution of Resistance Phenotypes to PARPi in Ovarian Cancer: Genotypic Heterogeneity vs. Phenotypic Plasticity
- **Aim 1:** Integrate multi-omics data (DNA sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and proteomics) to unravel the mechanisms of resistance to PARP1 inhibitors.
- **Aim 2:** Examine the fitness landscape dynamics of cancer cells under PARPi treatment.
- **Aim 3:** Utilize patient-derived organoid cultures to assess the roles of genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic plasticity in PARPi resistance.
