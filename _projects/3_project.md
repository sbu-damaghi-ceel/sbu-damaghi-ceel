### Project 3: Co-evolution of Tumor and Stroma in Breast Cancer
- **Aim 1:** Use a genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model of breast cancer to study the co-evolution of tumor cells and stromal cells.
- **Aim 2:** Develop spheroid and organoid cultures from both mouse and patient samples to model tumorâ€“stroma evolution.
- **Aim 3:** Analyze longitudinal patient samples with multiplex IHC staining to investigate tumor ecosystems.
