### Project 2: Metabolic Phenotypes in DCIS for Disease Progression and Upstaging Stratification
- **Aim 1:** Employ CODEX and Vectra multiplex IHC techniques to define metabolic phenotypes in longitudinal breast cancer patient samples (from DCIS to IDC to metastasis).
- **Aim 2:** Conduct comprehensive omics analyses on longitudinal patient samples to track evolutionary dynamics and design predictive biomarkers for progression and upstaging.
