# Research Interests: Evolution of Metabolic Phenotypes in Variable Tumor Microenvironments

The primary aim of my laboratory is to apply ecological and evolutionary principles to elucidate the molecular mechanisms driving the initiation, progression, and metastasis of breast and ovarian cancers through adaptation to their microenvironments. I hypothesize that the evolution of novel metabolic phenotypes under variable microenvironmental selection pressures can promote cancer development via metabolic reprogramming—linked to epigenetic modifications as well as the activation and stabilization of transcription factors.

Our research focuses on how tumor adaptation remodels the microenvironment and metabolism, creating new selective pressures. This dynamic interplay between tumor cells and their surrounding stroma is fundamental to the development of a constantly evolving tumor ecosystem, which in turn leads to increased genotypic heterogeneity and phenotypic plasticity. To capture this complexity, we integrate single-cell analyses across the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and pathomics.

## Main Projects in the Lab

### Project 1: Ecology and Evolution of Breast Carcinogenesis
- **Aim 1:** Investigate how microenvironmental selection influences the phenotypic switch in early breast cancer. Single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell ATAC sequencing will be employed to correlate phenotypes with mutation signatures.
- **Aim 2:** Utilize novel single-cell barcoding techniques to track clonal dynamics and correlate these with genotypic and phenotypic adaptations.
- **Aim 3:** Uncover the mechanisms behind metabolic reprogramming in early breast cancer cells.

### Project 2: Metabolic Phenotypes in DCIS for Disease Progression and Upstaging Stratification
- **Aim 1:** Employ CODEX and Vectra multiplex IHC techniques to define metabolic phenotypes in longitudinal breast cancer patient samples (from DCIS to IDC to metastasis).
- **Aim 2:** Conduct comprehensive omics analyses on longitudinal patient samples to track evolutionary dynamics and design predictive biomarkers for progression and upstaging.

### Project 3: Co-evolution of Tumor and Stroma in Breast Cancer
- **Aim 1:** Use a genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model of breast cancer to study the co-evolution of tumor cells and stromal cells.
- **Aim 2:** Develop spheroid and organoid cultures from both mouse and patient samples to model tumor–stroma evolution.
- **Aim 3:** Analyze longitudinal patient samples with multiplex IHC staining to investigate tumor ecosystems.

### Project 4: Evolution of Resistance Phenotypes to PARPi in Ovarian Cancer: Genotypic Heterogeneity vs. Phenotypic Plasticity
- **Aim 1:** Integrate multi-omics data (DNA sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and proteomics) to unravel the mechanisms of resistance to PARP1 inhibitors.
- **Aim 2:** Examine the fitness landscape dynamics of cancer cells under PARPi treatment.
- **Aim 3:** Utilize patient-derived organoid cultures to assess the roles of genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic plasticity in PARPi resistance.
