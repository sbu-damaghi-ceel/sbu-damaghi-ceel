In the systems biology domain, context-specific models facilitate extracting physiologically relevant information from high-quality data. Here, to utilize the heterogeneity of metabolic patterns to discover biomarkers of all cancers, we benchmarked thousands of context-specific models using well-established algorithms for the integration of omics data into the generic human metabolic model Recon3D. By analyzing the active reactions capable of carrying flux and their magnitude through flux balance analysis, we proved that the metabolic pattern of each cancer is unique and could act as a cancer metabolic fingerprint. Subsequently, we searched for proper feature selection methods to cluster the flux states characterizing each cancer. We employed PCA-based dimensionality reduction and a random forest learning algorithm to reveal reactions containing the most relevant information in order to effectively identify the most influential fluxes. Conclusively, we discovered different pathways that are probably the main sources for metabolic heterogeneity in cancers.

These complex, often non-linear interactions govern continuous spatial and temporal changes in the size and phenotypic properties of these subpopulations. Because intra-tumoral blood flow is often chaotic, competition for resources may be a critical selection factor in progression and prognosis. Here, we quantify resource competition using 3D spheroid cultures with MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. We hypothesized that MCF-7 cells, which primarily rely on efficient aerobic glucose metabolism, would dominate the population under normal pH and low glucose conditions; and MDA-MB-231 cells, which exhibit high levels of glycolytic metabolism, would dominate under low pH and high glucose conditions. In spheroids with single populations, MCF-7 cells exhibited equal or superior intrinsic growth rates (density-independent measure of success) and carrying capacities (density-dependent measure of success) when compared to MDA-MB-231 cells under all pH and nutrient conditions. Despite these advantages, when grown together, MCF-7 cells do not always outcompete MDA-MB-231 cells. MDA-MB-231 cells outcompete MCF-7 cells in low glucose conditions and coexistence is achieved in low pH conditions. Under all conditions, MDA-MB-231 has a stronger competitive effect (frequency-dependent interaction) on MCF-7 cells than vice-versa. This, and the inability of growth rate or carrying capacity when grown individually to predict the outcome of competition, suggests a reliance on frequency-dependent interactions and the need for competition assays. We frame these results in a game-theoretic (frequency-dependent) model of cancer cell interactions and conclude that competition assays can demonstrate critical density-independent, density-dependent and frequency-dependent interactions that likely contribute to in vivo outcomes.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Strobl2021-il" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Turnover modulates the need for a cost of resistance in adaptive therapy</div> <div class="author"> Maximilian A R Strobl, Jeffrey West, Yannick Viossat, <em>Mehdi Damaghi</em>, Mark Robertson-Tessi, Joel S Brown, Robert A Gatenby, Philip K Maini, and Alexander R A Anderson </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Cancer Res.</em>, Feb 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Adaptive therapy seeks to exploit intratumoral competition to avoid, or at least delay, the emergence of therapy resistance in cancer. Motivated by promising results in prostate cancer, there is growing interest in extending this approach to other neoplasms. As such, it is urgent to understand the characteristics of a cancer that determine whether or not it will respond well to adaptive therapy. A plausible candidate for such a selection criterion is the fitness cost of resistance. In this article, we study a general, but simple, mathematical model to investigate whether the presence of a cost is necessary for adaptive therapy to extend the time to progression beyond that of a standard-of-care continuous therapy. Tumor cells were divided into sensitive and resistant populations and we model their competition using a system of two ordinary differential equations based on the Lotka-Volterra model. For tumors close to their environmental carrying capacity, a cost was not required. However, for tumors growing far from carrying capacity, a cost may be required to see meaningful gains. Notably, it is important to consider cell turnover in the tumor, and we discuss its role in modulating the impact of a resistance cost. To conclude, we present evidence for the predicted cost-turnover interplay in data from 67 patients with prostate cancer undergoing intermittent androgen deprivation therapy. Our work helps to clarify under which circumstances adaptive therapy may be beneficial and suggests that turnover may play an unexpectedly important role in the decision-making process. SIGNIFICANCE: Tumor cell turnover modulates the speed of selection against drug resistance by amplifying the effects of competition and resistance costs; as such, turnover is an important factor in resistance management via adaptive therapy.See related commentary by Strobl et al., p. 811.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Damaghi2021-kx" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The harsh microenvironment in early breast cancer selects for a Warburg phenotype</div> <div class="author"> <em>Mehdi Damaghi</em>, Jeffrey West, Mark Robertson-Tessi, Liping Xu, Meghan C Ferrall-Fairbanks, Paul A Stewart, Erez Persi, Brooke L Fridley, Philipp M Altrock, Robert A Gatenby, Peter A Sims, Alexander R A Anderson, and Robert J Gillies </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Proc.

We hypothesize that the poor metabolic conditions near the ductal center foment the emergence of a Warburg Effect (WE) phenotype, wherein cells rapidly ferment glucose to lactic acid, even in normoxia. To test this hypothesis, we subjected low-glycolytic breast cancer cells to different microenvironmental selection pressures using combinations of hypoxia, acidosis, low glucose, and starvation for many months and isolated single clones for metabolic and transcriptomic profiling. The two harshest conditions selected for constitutively expressed WE phenotypes. RNA sequencing analysis of WE clones identified the transcription factor KLF4 as potential inducer of the WE phenotype. In stained DCIS samples, KLF4 expression was enriched in the area with the harshest microenvironmental conditions. We simulated in vivo DCIS phenotypic evolution using a mathematical model calibrated from the in vitro results. The WE phenotype emerged in the poor metabolic conditions near the necrotic core. We propose that harsh microenvironments within DCIS select for a WE phenotype through constitutive transcriptional reprogramming, thus conferring a survival advantage and facilitating further growth and invasion.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Pressley2021-wb" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Cycling hypoxia selects for constitutive HIF stabilization</div> <div class="author"> Mariyah Pressley, Jill A Gallaher, Joel S Brown, Michal R Tomaszewski, Punit Borad, <em>Mehdi Damaghi</em>, Robert J Gillies, and Christopher J Whelan </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Sci.

Hypoxia inducible transcription factors (HIF-α) respond to low levels of oxygen and induce re-supply oxygen. HIF-αstabilization is typically facultative, induced by hypoxia and reduced by normoxia. In some cancers, HIF-αstabilization becomes constitutive under normoxia. We develop a mathematical model that predicts how fluctuating oxygenation affects HIF-αstabilization and impacts net cell proliferation by balancing the base growth rate, the proliferative cost of HIF-αexpression, and the mortality from not expressing HIF-αduring hypoxia. We compare optimal net cell proliferation rate between facultative and constitutive HIF-αregulation in environments with different oxygen profiles. We find that that facultative HIF-αregulation promotes greater net cell proliferation than constitutive regulation with stochastic or slow periodicity in oxygenation. However, cell fitness is nearly identical for both HIF-αregulation strategies under rapid periodic oxygenation fluctuations. The model thus indicates that cells constitutively expressing HIF-αmay be at a selective advantage when the cost of expression is low. In cancer, this condition is known as pseudohypoxia or the “Warburg Effect”. We conclude that rapid and regular cycling of oxygenation levels selects for pseudohypoxia, and that this is consistent with the ecological theory of optimal defense.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Khajehdehi2021-ik" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Long noncoding RNAs in gastrointestinal cancer: Tumor suppression versus tumor promotion</div> <div class="author"> Mina Khajehdehi, Mohammad Khalaj-Kondori, Tayyebeh Ghasemi, Babak Jahanghiri, and <em>Mehdi Damaghi</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Dig.

They involve in the progression of different cancers by affecting transcriptional and post-transcriptional modifications as well as epigenetic control of numerous tumor suppressors and oncogenes. Recent findings show that aberrant expression of lncRNAs is associated with tumor initiation, progression, invasion, and overall survival of patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. Some lncRNAs play as tumor suppressors in all GI cancers, but others play as tumor promoters. However, some other lncRNAs might function as a tumor suppressor in one GI cancer, but as a tumor promoter in another GI cancer type. This fact highlights possible context dependency of the expression patterns and roles of at least some lncRNAs in GI cancer development and progression.

In solid tumors, such as breast ductal carcinoma, the extracellular environment for cells within the nascent tumor is harsh and imposes different types of stress on cells, such as hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and cytokine inflammation. Acidosis is a constant stressor of most cancer cells due to its production through fermentation of glucose to lactic acid in hypoxic or normoxic regions (Warburg effect). Over a short period of time, acid stress can have a profound effect on the function of lysosomes within the cells exposed to this environment, and after long term exposure, lysosomal function of the cancer cells can become completely dysregulated.

From nascent intraductal neoplasms to disseminated metastatic disease, several levels of evolutionary adaptations and selections occur. Here, we focus on one example of such an adaptation mechanism, namely, “niche construction” promoted by adaptation to acidosis, which is a metabolic adaptation to the early harsh environment in intraductal neoplasms. The avascular characteristics of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) make the periluminal volume profoundly acidic, and cancer cells must adapt to this to survive. Based on discovery proteomics, we hypothesized that a component of acid adaptation involves production of collagen by pre-cancer cells that remodels the extracellular matrix (ECM) and stabilizes cells under acid stress. The proteomic data were surprising as collagen production and deposition are commonly believed to be the responsibility of mesenchymally derived fibroblasts, and not cells of epithelial origin. Subsequent experiments in 3D culture, spinning disk and second harmonic generation microscopy of DCIS lesions in patients’ samples are concordant. Collagen production assay by acid-adapted cells in vitro demonstrated that the mechanism of induction involves the RAS and SMAD pathways. Secretome analyses show upregulation of ECM remodeling enzymes such as TGM2 and LOXL2 that are collagen crosslinkers. These data strongly indicate that acidosis in incipient cancers induces collagen production by cancer cells and support the hypothesis that this adaptation initiates a tumor-permissive microenvironment promoting survival and growth of nascent cancers.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Sadeghi2020-bx" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Integrative analysis of breast cancer cells reveals an epithelial-mesenchymal transition role in adaptation to acidic microenvironment</div> <div class="author"> Mehdi Sadeghi, Bryce Ordway, Ilyia Rafiei, Punit Borad, Bin Fang, John L Koomen, Chaomei Zhang, Sean Yoder, Joseph Johnson, and <em>Mehdi Damaghi</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Front.

High rates of glycolysis combined with poor perfusion lead to a congestion of acidic metabolites in the tumor microenvironment, and pre-malignant cells must adapt to this acidosis to thrive. Adaptation to acidosis selects cancer cells that can thrive in harsh conditions and are capable of outgrowing the normal or non-adapted neighbors. This selection is usually accompanied by phenotypic change. Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is one of the most important switches correlated to malignant tumor cell phenotype and has been shown to be induced by tumor acidosis. New evidence shows that the EMT switch is not a binary system and occurs on a spectrum of transition states. During confirmation of the EMT phenotype, our results demonstrated a partial EMT phenotype in our acid-adapted cell population. Using RNA sequencing and network analysis we found 10 dysregulated network motifs in acid-adapted breast cancer cells playing a role in EMT. Our further integrative analysis of RNA sequencing and SILAC proteomics resulted in recognition of S100B and S100A6 proteins at both the RNA and protein level. Higher expression of S100B and S100A6 was validated in vitro by Immunocytochemistry. We further validated our finding both in vitro and in patients’ samples by IHC analysis of Tissue Microarray (TMA). Correlation analysis of S100A6 and LAMP2b as marker of acidosis in each patient from Moffitt TMA approved the acid related role of S100A6 in breast cancer patients. Also, DCIS patients with higher expression of S100A6 showed lower survival compared to lower expression.

In an omics integrative approach, we integrated gene expression and genomic aberration data for pre-invasive (ductal carcinoma in situ; DCIS, early-stage) and post-invasive (invasive ductal carcinoma; IDC, late-stage) samples and investigated the evolutionary role of further genetic changes in later stages compared to the early ones. We found that single gene alterations (SGAs) and copy-number alterations (CNAs) work together in forward and backward evolution manners to fine-tune the signaling pathways operating in tumors. Analyses of the integrated point mutation and gene expression data showed that (i) our proposed fine-tuning concept is also applicable to metastasis, and (ii) metastases sometimes diverge from the primary tumor at the DCIS stage. Our results indicated that the malignant potency of breast tumors is constant over the pre- and post-invasive pathological stages. Indeed, further genetic alterations in later stages do not establish de novo malignancy routes; however, they serve to fine-tune antecedent signaling pathways.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Ordway2020-zm" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Targeting of evolutionarily acquired cancer cell phenotype by exploiting pHi-metabolic vulnerabilities</div> <div class="author"> Bryce Ordway, Michal Tomaszewski, Samantha Byrne, Dominique Abrahams, Pawel Swietach, Robert J Gillies, and <em>Mehdi Damaghi</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Cancers (Basel)</em>, Dec 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Evolutionary dynamics can be used to control cancers when a cure is not clinically considered to be achievable. Understanding Darwinian intratumoral interactions of microenvironmental selection forces can be used to steer tumor progression towards a less invasive trajectory. Here, we approach intratumoral heterogeneity and evolution as a dynamic interaction among subpopulations through the application of small, but selective biological forces such as intracellular pH (pHi) and/or extracellular pH (pHe) vulnerabilities. Increased glycolysis is a prominent phenotype of cancer cells under hypoxia or normoxia (Warburg effect). Glycolysis leads to an important aspect of cancer metabolism: reduced pHe and higher pHi. We recently showed that decreasing pHi and targeting pHi sensitive enzymes can reverse the Warburg effect (WE) phenotype and inhibit tumor progression. Herein, we used diclofenac (DIC) repurposed to control MCT activity, and Koningic acid (KA) that is a GAPDH partial inhibitor, and observed that we can control the subpopulation of cancer cells with WE phenotype within a tumor in favor of a less aggressive phenotype without a WE to control progression and metastasis. In a 3D spheroid co-cultures, we showed that our strategy can control the growth of more aggressive MDA-MB-231 cells, while sparing the less aggressive MCF7 cells. In an animal model, we show that our approach can reduce tumor growth and metastasis. We thus propose that evolutionary dynamics can be used to control tumor cells’ clonal or sub-clonal populations in favor of slower growth and less damage to patients.

Traditionally, invasion is thought to be driven by cells that have acquired all the necessary traits to overcome the range of biological and physical defences employed by the body. However, in light of the ever-increasing evidence for geno- and phenotypic intra-tumour heterogeneity, an alternative hypothesis presents itself: could invasion be driven by a collection of cells with distinct traits that together facilitate the invasion process? In this paper, we use a mathematical model to assess the feasibility of this hypothesis in the context of acid-mediated invasion. We assume tumour expansion is obstructed by stroma which inhibits growth and extra-cellular matrix (ECM) which blocks cancer cell movement. Further, we assume that there are two types of cancer cells: (i) a glycolytic phenotype which produces acid that kills stromal cells and (ii) a matrix-degrading phenotype that locally remodels the ECM. We extend the Gatenby-Gawlinski reaction-diffusion model to derive a system of five coupled reaction-diffusion equations to describe the resulting invasion process. We characterise the spatially homogeneous steady states and carry out a simulation study in one spatial dimension to determine how the tumour develops as we vary the strength of competition between the two phenotypes. We find that overall tumour growth is most extensive when both cell types can stably coexist, since this allows the cells to locally mix and benefit most from the combination of traits. In contrast, when inter-species competition exceeds intra-species competition the populations spatially separate and invasion arrests either: (i) rapidly (matrix-degraders dominate) or (ii) slowly (acid-producers dominate). Overall, our work demonstrates that the spatial and ecological relationship between a heterogeneous population of tumour cells is a key factor in determining their ability to cooperate. Specifically, we predict that tumours in which different phenotypes coexist stably are more invasive than tumours in which phenotypes are spatially separated.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Wu2020-wx" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">T-cells produce acidic niches in lymph nodes to suppress their own effector functions</div> <div class="author"> Hao Wu, Veronica Estrella, Matthew Beatty, Dominique Abrahams, Asmaa El-Kenawi, Shonagh Russell, Arig Ibrahim-Hashim, Dario Livio Longo, Yana K Reshetnyak, Anna Moshnikova, Oleg A Andreev, Kimberly Luddy, <em>Mehdi Damaghi</em>, Krithika Kodumudi, Smitha R Pillai, Pedro Enriquez-Navas, Shari Pilon-Thomas, Pawel Swietach, and Robert J Gillies </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Nat.

These acidic niches are absent in athymic Nu/Nu and lymphodepleted mice, implicating T-cells in the acidifying process. T-cell glycolysis is inhibited at the low pH observed in LNs.

Instead, it became apparent that an understanding of cancer genomics, alone, is unable to translate the wealth of information into successful cures. While gene sequencing has significantly improved our understanding of the natural history of cancer and identified candidates for therapeutic targets, it cannot predict the impact of the biological response to therapies. Hence, patients with a common mutational profile may respond differently to the same therapy, due in part to different microenvironments impacting on gene regulation. This complexity arises from a feedback circuit involving epigenetic modifications made to genes by the metabolic byproducts of cancer cells. New insights into epigenetic mechanisms, activated early in the process of carcinogenesis, have been able to describe phenotypes which cannot be inferred from mutational analyses per se. Epigenetic changes can propagate throughout a tumor via heritable modifications that have long-lasting consequences on ensuing phenotypes. Such heritable epigenetic changes can be evoked profoundly by cancer cell metabolites, which then exercise a broad remit of actions across all stages of carcinogenesis, culminating with a meaningful impact on the tumor’s response to therapy. This review outlines some of the cross-talk between heritable epigenetic changes and tumor cell metabolism, and the consequences of such changes on tumor progression.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Pillai2019-ua" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Causes, consequences, and therapy of tumors acidosis</div> <div class="author"> Smitha R Pillai, <em>Mehdi Damaghi</em>, Yoshinori Marunaka, Enrico Pierluigi Spugnini, Stefano Fais, and Robert J Gillies </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Cancer Metastasis Rev.</em>, Jun 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>While cancer is commonly described as “a disease of the genes,” it is also associated with massive metabolic reprogramming that is now accepted as a disease “Hallmark.” This programming is complex and often involves metabolic cooperativity between cancer cells and their surrounding stroma. Indeed, there is emerging clinical evidence that interrupting a cancer’s metabolic program can improve patients’ outcomes. The most commonly observed and well-studied metabolic adaptation in cancers is the fermentation of glucose to lactic acid, even in the presence of oxygen, also known as “aerobic glycolysis” or the “Warburg Effect.” Much has been written about the mechanisms of the Warburg effect, and this remains a topic of great debate. However, herein, we will focus on an important sequela of this metabolic program: the acidification of the tumor microenvironment. Rather than being an epiphenomenon, it is now appreciated that this acidosis is a key player in cancer somatic evolution and progression to malignancy. Adaptation to acidosis induces and selects for malignant behaviors, such as increased invasion and metastasis, chemoresistance, and inhibition of immune surveillance. However, the metabolic reprogramming that occurs during adaptation to acidosis also introduces therapeutic vulnerabilities. Thus, tumor acidosis is a relevant therapeutic target, and we describe herein four approaches to accomplish this: (1) neutralizing acid directly with buffers, (2) targeting metabolic vulnerabilities revealed by acidosis, (3) developing acid-activatable drugs and nanomedicines, and (4) inhibiting metabolic processes responsible for generating acids in the first place.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2018</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Persi2018-ku" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Systems analysis of intracellular pH vulnerabilities for cancer therapy</div> <div class="author"> Erez Persi, Miquel Duran-Frigola, <em>Mehdi Damaghi</em>, William R Roush, Patrick Aloy, John L Cleveland, Robert J Gillies, and Eytan Ruppin </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Nat.

By reconstructing and integrating enzymatic pH-dependent activity profiles into cell-specific genome-scale metabolic models, we develop a computational methodology that explores how intracellular pH (pHi) can modulate metabolism. We show that in silico, alkaline pHi maximizes cancer cell proliferation coupled to increased glycolysis and adaptation to hypoxia (i.e., the Warburg effect), whereas acidic pHi disables these adaptations and compromises tumor cell growth. We then systematically identify metabolic targets (GAPDH and GPI) with predicted amplified anti-cancer effects at acidic pHi, forming a novel therapeutic strategy. Experimental testing of this strategy in breast cancer cells reveals that it is particularly effective against aggressive phenotypes.

Hence, heterogeneity of phenotypes is an indirect consequence of altering microenvironments during carcinogenesis. In early stages of growth, tumors are stratified, with the most aggressive cells developing within the acidic interior of the tumor. However, these cells eventually find themselves at the tumor edge, where they invade into the normal tissue via acid-mediated invasion. We believe acid adaptation during the evolution of cancer cells in their niche is a Rubicon that, once crossed, allows cells to invade into and outcompete normal stromal tissue.

In three spontaneous murine cancers (prostate cancers in TRAMP and PTEN mice, pancreatic cancer in KPC mice), we identified two subpopulations with distinct niche construction adaptive strategies that remained stable in culture: (i) invasive cells that produce an acidic environment via upregulated aerobic glycolysis; and (ii) noninvasive cells that were angiogenic and metabolically near-normal. Darwinian interactions of these subpopulations were investigated in TRAMP prostate cancers. Computer simulations demonstrated invasive, acid-producing (C2) cells maintain a fitness advantage over noninvasive, angiogenic (C3) cells by promoting invasion and reducing efficacy of immune response. Immunohistochemical analysis of untreated tumors confirmed that C2 cells were invariably more abundant than C3 cells. However, the C2 adaptive strategy phenotype incurred a significant cost due to inefficient energy production (i.e., aerobic glycolysis) and depletion of resources for adaptations to an acidic environment. Mathematical model simulations predicted that small perturbations of the microenvironmental extracellular pH (pHe) could invert the cost/benefit ratio of the C2 strategy and select for C3 cells. In vivo, 200 mmol/L NaHCO3 added to the drinking water of 4-week-old TRAMP mice increased the intraprostatic pHe by 0.2 units and promoted proliferation of noninvasive C3 cells, which remained confined within the ducts so that primary cancer did not develop. A 0.2 pHe increase in established tumors increased the fraction of C3 cells and signficantly diminished growth of primary and metastatic tumors. In an experimental tumor construct, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were coinjected into the mammary fat pad of SCID mice. C2-like MDA-MB-231 cells dominated in untreated animals, but C3-like MCF7 cells were selected and tumor growth slowed when intratumoral pHe was increased. Overall, our data support the use of mathematical modeling of intratumoral Darwinian interactions of environmental selection forces and cancer cell adaptive strategies. These models allow the tumor to be steered into a less invasive pathway through the application of small but selective biological force.

Solid tumors are characterized by a highly acidic microenvironment that might blunt the effectiveness of antitumor immunity. In this study, we directly investigated the effects of tumor acidity on the efficacy of immunotherapy. An acidic pH environment blocked T-cell activation and limited glycolysis in vitro. IFNγrelease blocked by acidic pH did not occur at the level of steady-state mRNA, implying that the effect of acidity was posttranslational. Acidification did not affect cytoplasmic pH, suggesting that signals transduced by external acidity were likely mediated by specific acid-sensing receptors, four of which are expressed by T cells. Notably, neutralizing tumor acidity with bicarbonate monotherapy impaired the growth of some cancer types in mice where it was associated with increased T-cell infiltration. Furthermore, combining bicarbonate therapy with anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD1, or adoptive T-cell transfer improved antitumor responses in multiple models, including cures in some subjects. Overall, our findings show how raising intratumoral pH through oral buffers therapy can improve responses to immunotherapy, with the potential for immediate clinical translation.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Damaghi2016-sj" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Lysosomal protein relocation as an adaptation mechanism to extracellular acidosis</div> <div class="author"> <em>Mehdi Damaghi</em>, and Robert J Gillies </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Cell Cycle</em>, Jul 2016 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2015</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Damaghi2015-hd" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Chronic acidosis in the tumour microenvironment selects for overexpression of LAMP2 in the plasma membrane</div> <div class="author"> <em>Mehdi Damaghi</em>, Narges K Tafreshi, Mark C Lloyd, Robert Sprung, Veronica Estrella, Jonathan W Wojtkowiak, David L Morse, John M Koomen, Marilyn M Bui, Robert A Gatenby, and Robert J Gillies </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Nat.

Here, we investigate MCF-7 cells that are adapted to grow in acidic conditions using SILAC proteomics and we reveal a significant upregulation of lysosomal proteins. Prominent among these is LAMP2 that functions to protect lysosomal membranes from acid proteolysis. LAMP2 upregulation by acidosis is confirmed both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we show that the depletion of LAMP2 is sufficient to increase acidosis-mediated toxicity. In breast cancer patient samples, there is a high correlation of LAMP2 mRNA and protein expression with progression. We also observe that LAMP2 is located at the plasma membrane in clinical samples and this redistribution is acid-induced in vitro. Our findings suggest a potential adaptive mechanism, wherein cells chronically exposed to an acidic environment translocate lysosomal proteins to their surface, thus protecting the plasmalemma from acid-induced hydrolysis.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2013</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Damaghi2013-dr" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">pH sensing and regulation in cancer</div> <div class="author"> <em>Mehdi Damaghi</em>, Jonathan W Wojtkowiak, and Robert J Gillies </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Front.

These sensors have the ability to recognize and induce cellular responses to maintain the pHi, often at the expense of acidifying the extracellular pH. In turn, extracellular acidification impacts cells via specific acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) and proton-sensing G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). In this review, we will discuss some of the major players in proton sensing at the plasma membrane and their downstream consequences in cancer cells and how these pH-mediated changes affect processes such as migration and metastasis. The complex mechanisms by which they transduce acid pH signals to the cytoplasm and nucleus are not well understood. However, there is evidence that expression of proton-sensing GPCRs such as GPR4, TDAG8, and OGR1 can regulate aspects of tumorigenesis and invasion, including cofilin and talin regulated actin (de-)polymerization. Major mechanisms for maintenance of pHi homeostasis include monocarboxylate, bicarbonate, and proton transporters. Notably, there is little evidence suggesting a link between their activities and those of the extracellular H(+)-sensors, suggesting a mechanistic disconnect between intra- and extracellular pH. Understanding the mechanisms of pH sensing and regulation may lead to novel and informed therapeutic strategies that can target acidosis, a common physical hallmark of solid tumors.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2011</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Damaghi2011-id" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">One βhairpin follows the other: exploring refolding pathways and kinetics of the transmembrane β-barrel protein OmpG</div> <div class="author"> <em>Mehdi Damaghi</em>, Stefan Köster, Christian A Bippes, Ozkan Yildiz, and Daniel J Müller </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Angew.

The two functional states of OmpG take the same unfolding pathway during the sequential unfolding of β-hairpins I-IV. After the initial unfolding events, the unfolding pathways diverge. In the open state, the unfolding of β-hairpin V in one step precedes the unfolding of β-hairpin VI. In the closed state, β-hairpin V and β-strand S11 with a part of extracellular loop L6 unfold cooperatively, and subsequently β-strand S12 unfolds with the remaining loop L6. These two unfolding pathways in the open and closed states join again in the last unfolding step of β-hairpin VII. Also, the conformational change from the open to the closed state witnesses a rigidified extracellular gating loop L6.

Here, we used single-molecule force spectroscopy to structurally localize and quantify the interactions that are associated with the pH-dependent closure.
