               the energy barriers in the unfolding energy landscape of the
               outer membrane protein G (OmpG) from Escherichia coli. The
               pH-dependent functional switching of OmpG directs the protein

               two functional states of OmpG take the same unfolding pathway
               during the sequential unfolding of $\beta$-hairpins I-IV. After
               the initial unfolding events, the unfolding pathways diverge. In
               the open state, the unfolding of $\beta$-hairpin V in one step
               precedes the unfolding of $\beta$-hairpin VI. In the closed
               state, $\beta$-hairpin V and $\beta$-strand S11 with a part of
               extracellular loop L6 unfold cooperatively, and subsequently
               $\beta$-strand S12 unfolds with the remaining loop L6. These two

  abstract  = "Growing tumors are dynamic and nonlinear ecosystems, wherein
               cancer cells adapt to their local microenvironment, and these
               adaptations further modify the environment, inducing more
               changes. From nascent intraductal neoplasms to disseminated
               metastatic disease, several levels of evolutionary adaptations
               and selections occur. Here, we focus on one example of such an
               adaptation mechanism, namely, ``niche construction'' promoted by
               adaptation to acidosis, which is a metabolic adaptation to the
               early harsh environment in intraductal neoplasms. The avascular
               characteristics of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) make the
               periluminal volume profoundly acidic, and cancer cells must
               adapt to this to survive. Based on discovery proteomics, we
               hypothesized that a component of acid adaptation involves
               production of collagen by pre-cancer cells that remodels the
               extracellular matrix (ECM) and stabilizes cells under acid
               stress. The proteomic data were surprising as collagen
               production and deposition are commonly believed to be the
               responsibility of mesenchymally derived fibroblasts, and not
               cells of epithelial origin. Subsequent experiments in 3D
               culture, spinning disk and second harmonic generation microscopy
               of DCIS lesions in patients' samples are concordant. Collagen
               production assay by acid-adapted cells in vitro demonstrated
               that the mechanism of induction involves the RAS and SMAD
               pathways. Secretome analyses show upregulation of ECM remodeling
               enzymes such as TGM2 and LOXL2 that are collagen crosslinkers.
               These data strongly indicate that acidosis in incipient cancers
               induces collagen production by cancer cells and support the
               hypothesis that this adaptation initiates a tumor-permissive
               microenvironment promoting survival and growth of nascent
               cancers.",

               congestion of acidic metabolites in the tumor microenvironment,
               and pre-malignant cells must adapt to this acidosis to thrive.
               Adaptation to acidosis selects cancer cells that can thrive in
               harsh conditions and are capable of outgrowing the normal or
               non-adapted neighbors. This selection is usually accompanied by
               phenotypic change. Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is
               one of the most important switches correlated to malignant tumor
               cell phenotype and has been shown to be induced by tumor
               acidosis. New evidence shows that the EMT switch is not a binary
               system and occurs on a spectrum of transition states. During
               confirmation of the EMT phenotype, our results demonstrated a
               partial EMT phenotype in our acid-adapted cell population. Using
               RNA sequencing and network analysis we found 10 dysregulated
               network motifs in acid-adapted breast cancer cells playing a
               role in EMT. Our further integrative analysis of RNA sequencing
               and SILAC proteomics resulted in recognition of S100B and S100A6
               proteins at both the RNA and protein level. Higher expression of
               S100B and S100A6 was validated in vitro by Immunocytochemistry.
               We further validated our finding both in vitro and in patients'
               samples by IHC analysis of Tissue Microarray (TMA). Correlation
               analysis of S100A6 and LAMP2b as marker of acidosis in each
               patient from Moffitt TMA approved the acid related role of
               S100A6 in breast cancer patients. Also, DCIS patients with
               higher expression of S100A6 showed lower survival compared to
               lower expression. We propose essential roles of acid adaptation
               in cancer cells EMT process through S100 proteins such as S100A6

  abstract = "The inter- and intra-tumoral metabolic phenotypes of tumors are

              decreased pH, and these local microenvironment effects lead to
              further selection. Hence, heterogeneity of phenotypes is an
              indirect consequence of altering microenvironments during

              with the most aggressive cells developing within the acidic

               environmental selection forces and cellular phenotypic
               adaptations that govern the underlying Darwinian dynamics. In
               three spontaneous murine cancers (prostate cancers in TRAMP and
               PTEN mice, pancreatic cancer in KPC mice), we identified two
               subpopulations with distinct niche construction adaptive
               strategies that remained stable in culture: (i) invasive cells
               that produce an acidic environment via upregulated aerobic
               glycolysis; and (ii) noninvasive cells that were angiogenic and
               metabolically near-normal. Darwinian interactions of these
               subpopulations were investigated in TRAMP prostate cancers.
               Computer simulations demonstrated invasive, acid-producing (C2)
               cells maintain a fitness advantage over noninvasive, angiogenic
               (C3) cells by promoting invasion and reducing efficacy of immune
               response. Immunohistochemical analysis of untreated tumors
               confirmed that C2 cells were invariably more abundant than C3
               cells. However, the C2 adaptive strategy phenotype incurred a
               significant cost due to inefficient energy production (i.e.,
               aerobic glycolysis) and depletion of resources for adaptations
               to an acidic environment. Mathematical model simulations
               predicted that small perturbations of the microenvironmental
               extracellular pH (pHe) could invert the cost/benefit ratio of
               the C2 strategy and select for C3 cells. In vivo, 200 mmol/L
               NaHCO3 added to the drinking water of 4-week-old TRAMP mice
               increased the intraprostatic pHe by 0.2 units and promoted
               proliferation of noninvasive C3 cells, which remained confined
               within the ducts so that primary cancer did not develop. A 0.2
               pHe increase in established tumors increased the fraction of C3
               cells and signficantly diminished growth of primary and
               metastatic tumors. In an experimental tumor construct, MCF7 and
               MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were coinjected into the mammary
               fat pad of SCID mice. C2-like MDA-MB-231 cells dominated in
               untreated animals, but C3-like MCF7 cells were selected and
               tumor growth slowed when intratumoral pHe was increased.
               Overall, our data support the use of mathematical modeling of
               intratumoral Darwinian interactions of environmental selection
               forces and cancer cell adaptive strategies. These models allow
               the tumor to be steered into a less invasive pathway through the
               application of small but selective biological force. Cancer Res;

               is not clinically considered to be achievable. Understanding
               Darwinian intratumoral interactions of microenvironmental
               selection forces can be used to steer tumor progression towards
               a less invasive trajectory. Here, we approach intratumoral
               heterogeneity and evolution as a dynamic interaction among
               subpopulations through the application of small, but selective
               biological forces such as intracellular pH (pHi) and/or
               extracellular pH (pHe) vulnerabilities. Increased glycolysis is
               a prominent phenotype of cancer cells under hypoxia or normoxia
               (Warburg effect). Glycolysis leads to an important aspect of
               cancer metabolism: reduced pHe and higher pHi. We recently
               showed that decreasing pHi and targeting pHi sensitive enzymes
               can reverse the Warburg effect (WE) phenotype and inhibit tumor
               progression. Herein, we used diclofenac (DIC) repurposed to
               control MCT activity, and Koningic acid (KA) that is a GAPDH
               partial inhibitor, and observed that we can control the
               subpopulation of cancer cells with WE phenotype within a tumor
               in favor of a less aggressive phenotype without a WE to control
               progression and metastasis. In a 3D spheroid co-cultures, we
               showed that our strategy can control the growth of more
               aggressive MDA-MB-231 cells, while sparing the less aggressive
               MCF7 cells. In an animal model, we show that our approach can
               reduce tumor growth and metastasis. We thus propose that
               evolutionary dynamics can be used to control tumor cells' clonal
               or sub-clonal populations in favor of slower growth and less
               damage to patients. We propose that this can result in cancer

  abstract  = "Invasion of healthy tissue is a defining feature of malignant
               tumours. Traditionally, invasion is thought to be driven by
               cells that have acquired all the necessary traits to overcome
               the range of biological and physical defences employed by the
               body. However, in light of the ever-increasing evidence for
               geno- and phenotypic intra-tumour heterogeneity, an alternative
               hypothesis presents itself: could invasion be driven by a
               collection of cells with distinct traits that together
               facilitate the invasion process? In this paper, we use a
               mathematical model to assess the feasibility of this hypothesis
               in the context of acid-mediated invasion. We assume tumour
               expansion is obstructed by stroma which inhibits growth and
               extra-cellular matrix (ECM) which blocks cancer cell movement.
               Further, we assume that there are two types of cancer cells: (i)
               a glycolytic phenotype which produces acid that kills stromal
               cells and (ii) a matrix-degrading phenotype that locally
               remodels the ECM. We extend the Gatenby-Gawlinski
               reaction-diffusion model to derive a system of five coupled
               reaction-diffusion equations to describe the resulting invasion
               process. We characterise the spatially homogeneous steady states
               and carry out a simulation study in one spatial dimension to
               determine how the tumour develops as we vary the strength of
               competition between the two phenotypes. We find that overall
               tumour growth is most extensive when both cell types can stably
               coexist, since this allows the cells to locally mix and benefit
               most from the combination of traits. In contrast, when
               inter-species competition exceeds intra-species competition the
               populations spatially separate and invasion arrests either: (i)
               rapidly (matrix-degraders dominate) or (ii) slowly
               (acid-producers dominate). Overall, our work demonstrates that
               the spatial and ecological relationship between a heterogeneous
               population of tumour cells is a key factor in determining their
               ability to cooperate. Specifically, we predict that tumours in
               which different phenotypes coexist stably are more invasive than
               tumours in which phenotypes are spatially separated.",

               competition using 3D spheroid cultures with MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7

               dominate the population under normal pH and low glucose
               conditions; and MDA-MB-231 cells, which exhibit high levels of
               glycolytic metabolism, would dominate under low pH and high
               glucose conditions. In spheroids with single populations, MCF-7
               cells exhibited equal or superior intrinsic growth rates
               (density-independent measure of success) and carrying capacities

               frequency-dependent interactions and the need for competition

               of a standard-of-care continuous therapy. Tumor cells were
               divided into sensitive and resistant populations and we model
               their competition using a system of two ordinary differential
               equations based on the Lotka-Volterra model. For tumors close to
               their environmental carrying capacity, a cost was not required.
               However, for tumors growing far from carrying capacity, a cost
               may be required to see meaningful gains. Notably, it is
               important to consider cell turnover in the tumor, and we discuss
               its role in modulating the impact of a resistance cost. To
               conclude, we present evidence for the predicted cost-turnover
               interplay in data from 67 patients with prostate cancer
               undergoing intermittent androgen deprivation therapy. Our work
               helps to clarify under which circumstances adaptive therapy may
               be beneficial and suggests that turnover may play an
               unexpectedly important role in the decision-making process.
               SIGNIFICANCE: Tumor cell turnover modulates the speed of
               selection against drug resistance by amplifying the effects of
               competition and resistance costs; as such, turnover is an
               important factor in resistance management via adaptive
               therapy.See related commentary by Strobl et al., p. 811.",

               We hypothesize that the poor metabolic conditions near the
               ductal center foment the emergence of a Warburg Effect (WE)
               phenotype, wherein cells rapidly ferment glucose to lactic acid,
               even in normoxia. To test this hypothesis, we subjected
               low-glycolytic breast cancer cells to different

               hypoxia, acidosis, low glucose, and starvation for many months

               constitutively expressed WE phenotypes. RNA sequencing analysis
               of WE clones identified the transcription factor KLF4 as

               widely anticipated that the sought-after cure will be delivered
               promptly. Instead, it became apparent that an understanding of
               cancer genomics, alone, is unable to translate the wealth of
               information into successful cures. While gene sequencing has
               significantly improved our understanding of the natural history
               of cancer and identified candidates for therapeutic targets, it
               cannot predict the impact of the biological response to
               therapies. Hence, patients with a common mutational profile may
               respond differently to the same therapy, due in part to
               different microenvironments impacting on gene regulation. This
               complexity arises from a feedback circuit involving epigenetic
               modifications made to genes by the metabolic byproducts of
               cancer cells. New insights into epigenetic mechanisms, activated
               early in the process of carcinogenesis, have been able to
               describe phenotypes which cannot be inferred from mutational
               analyses per se. Epigenetic changes can propagate throughout a

               (HIF-$\alpha$) respond to low levels of oxygen and induce
               re-supply oxygen. HIF-$\alpha$ stabilization is typically
               facultative, induced by hypoxia and reduced by normoxia. In some
               cancers, HIF-$\alpha$ stabilization becomes constitutive under
               normoxia. We develop a mathematical model that predicts how
               fluctuating oxygenation affects HIF-$\alpha$ stabilization and
               impacts net cell proliferation by balancing the base growth
               rate, the proliferative cost of HIF-$\alpha$ expression, and the
               mortality from not expressing HIF-$\alpha$ during hypoxia. We
               compare optimal net cell proliferation rate between facultative
               and constitutive HIF-$\alpha$ regulation in environments with
               different oxygen profiles. We find that that facultative

               constitutively expressing HIF-$\alpha$ may be at a selective
               advantage when the cost of expression is low. In cancer, this
               condition is known as pseudohypoxia or the ``Warburg Effect''.
               We conclude that rapid and regular cycling of oxygenation levels

               sensors have the ability to recognize and induce cellular
               responses to maintain the pHi, often at the expense of
               acidifying the extracellular pH. In turn, extracellular
               acidification impacts cells via specific acid-sensing ion
               channels (ASICs) and proton-sensing G-protein coupled receptors
               (GPCRs). In this review, we will discuss some of the major
               players in proton sensing at the plasma membrane and their
               downstream consequences in cancer cells and how these
               pH-mediated changes affect processes such as migration and
               metastasis. The complex mechanisms by which they transduce acid

               However, there is evidence that expression of proton-sensing

               genes,'' it is also associated with massive metabolic
               reprogramming that is now accepted as a disease ``Hallmark.''
               This programming is complex and often involves metabolic
               cooperativity between cancer cells and their surrounding stroma.
               Indeed, there is emerging clinical evidence that interrupting a
               cancer's metabolic program can improve patients' outcomes. The
               most commonly observed and well-studied metabolic adaptation in
               cancers is the fermentation of glucose to lactic acid, even in
               the presence of oxygen, also known as ``aerobic glycolysis'' or
               the ``Warburg Effect.'' Much has been written about the
               mechanisms of the Warburg effect, and this remains a topic of
               great debate. However, herein, we will focus on an important
               sequela of this metabolic program: the acidification of the
               tumor microenvironment. Rather than being an epiphenomenon, it
               is now appreciated that this acidosis is a key player in cancer
               somatic evolution and progression to malignancy. Adaptation to
               acidosis induces and selects for malignant behaviors, such as
               increased invasion and metastasis, chemoresistance, and
               inhibition of immune surveillance. However, the metabolic
               reprogramming that occurs during adaptation to acidosis also
               introduces therapeutic vulnerabilities. Thus, tumor acidosis is
               a relevant therapeutic target, and we describe herein four
               approaches to accomplish this: (1) neutralizing acid directly
               with buffers, (2) targeting metabolic vulnerabilities revealed
               by acidosis, (3) developing acid-activatable drugs and
               nanomedicines, and (4) inhibiting metabolic processes
