  abstract = "Cancers evolve in a dynamic ecosystem. Thus, characterizing
              cancer's ecological dynamics is crucial to understanding cancer
              evolution and can lead to discovering novel biomarkers to predict
              disease progression. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is an
              early-stage breast cancer characterized by abnormal epithelial
              cell growth confined within the milk ducts. In this study, we show
              that ecological habitat analysis of hypoxia and acidosis
              biomarkers can significantly improve prediction of DCIS upstaging.
              First, we developed a novel eco-evolutionary designed approach to
              define habitats in the tumor intraductal microenvironment based on
              oxygen diffusion distance. Then, we identify cancer cells with
              metabolic phenotypes attributed to their habitat conditions, such
              as the expression of CA9 indicating hypoxia responding phenotype,
              and LAMP2b indicating the acid adaptation. Traditionally these
              markers have shown limited predictive capabilities for DCIS
              upstaging, if any. However, when analyzed from an ecological
              perspective, their power to differentiate between pure DCIS and
              upstaged DCIS increased significantly. Second, using
              eco-evolutionary guided computational and digital pathology
              techniques, we discovered distinct niches with spatial patterns of
              these biomarkers and used the distribution of such niches to
              predict patient upstaging. The niches patterns were characterized
              by pattern analysis of both cellular and spatial features. With a
              5-fold validation on the biopsy cohort, we trained a random forest
              classifier to achieve the area under curve (AUC) of 0.74. Our
              results affirm the importance of using eco-evolutionary-designed
              approaches in biomarkers discovery studies in the era of digital
              pathology by demonstrating the role of tumor ecological habitats

              normal and neoplastic cells are robust to the mutational stressors
              in the microenvironment to the extent that secure their fitness.
              To test the robustness of genes under a range of mutagens, we
              developed a sequential mutation simulator, Sinabro, to simulate
              single base substitution under a given mutational process. Then,
              we developed a pipeline to measure the robustness of genes and
              cells under those mutagenesis processes. We discovered significant
              human genome robustness to the APOBEC mutational signature SBS2,
              which is associated with viral defense mechanisms and is
              implicated in cancer. Robustness evaluations across over 70,000
              sequences against 41 signatures showed higher resilience under
              signatures predominantly causing C-to-T (G-to-A) mutations.
              Principal component analysis indicates the GC content at the
              codon's wobble position significantly influences robustness, with
              increased resilience noted under transition mutations compared to
              transversions. Then, we tested our results in bats at extremes of
              the lifespan-to-mass relationship and found the long-lived bat is
              more robust to APOBEC than the short-lived one. By revealing
              robustness to APOBEC ranked highest in human (and bats with much
              more than number of APOBEC) genome, this work bolsters the key
              potential role of APOBECs in aging and cancer, as well as evolved
              countermeasures to this innate mutagenic process. It also provides

               therapies and immunotherapies offer more options for sequential
               or combined treatments. Nevertheless, mortality in metastatic
               ovarian cancer patients remains high because cancer cells
               consistently develop resistance to single and combination
               therapies, urging a need for treatment designs that target the
               evolvability of cancer cells. The evolutionary dynamics that lead

               the heterogeneous populations, and the individual cancer cell's

               and dynamic ways. Conventional therapies for ovarian cancer
               inevitably lead to the development of resistance because they
               fail to consider tumours' heterogeneity and cellular plasticity.
               Eco-evolutionarily designed therapies should consider cancer cell
               plasticity and patient-specific characteristics to improve

abstract = {It was previously reported that dendrosomes, i.e. neutral, biodegradable, covalent or self-assembled, hyperbranched, spheroidal nano-particles with a size ranging from 15 to 100 nm, provide a convenient and efficient means of gene delivery into various kinds of cells such as human hepatoma and kidney cells as well as animal models. RESULTS: New studies via circular dichroism show that hydrophilic and amphipathic dendrosomes either do not affect the DNA structure or moderately transform it from B- to A-conformation. Gene delivery into human liver, kidney, and endothelial cells as well as other animal cells like Bowes, U-937, Raw, CCRF-CEM, MOLT-4, K562, Huh-7 and VERO reveal that the genes are efficiently expressed and in comparison with other gene porters like Lipofectin or bacterial ghosts, do quite well. It is also shown that dendrosomes are able to deliver genes into cells like endothelials that are usually hard to transfect. Cell culture experiments as well as intraperitoneal/intradermal injections of dendrosomes into mice establish their nontoxicity (up to 2.5 mg kg−1 of animal weight in the latter case). Studies on immunization of BALB/c mice using conventional adjuvants such as aluminium phosphate, CpG motif and one of the dendrosomes, indicate that the latter leads to the mildest initial response development while exceeding them afterwards. CONCLUSION: CD studies reveal that, owing to the neutrality of dendrosomes, formation of Den/DNA complexes is accompanied by slight structural modifications of DNA cell culture, and animal studies reveal that dendrosomes are inert, non-toxic and highly efficient gene porters that perform at extremely low doses. In comparison with bacterial ghosts and some common porters, they are efficient in delivery of genes into animals and a variety of cells including those that are usually hard to transfect.},
