  abstract = "Cancers evolve in a dynamic ecosystem. Thus, characterizing
              cancer's ecological dynamics is crucial to understanding cancer
              evolution and can lead to discovering novel biomarkers to predict
              disease progression. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is an
              early-stage breast cancer characterized by abnormal epithelial
              cell growth confined within the milk ducts. In this study, we show
              that ecological habitat analysis of hypoxia and acidosis
              biomarkers can significantly improve prediction of DCIS upstaging.
              First, we developed a novel eco-evolutionary designed approach to
              define habitats in the tumor intraductal microenvironment based on
              oxygen diffusion distance. Then, we identify cancer cells with
              metabolic phenotypes attributed to their habitat conditions, such
              as the expression of CA9 indicating hypoxia responding phenotype,
              and LAMP2b indicating the acid adaptation. Traditionally these
              markers have shown limited predictive capabilities for DCIS
              upstaging, if any. However, when analyzed from an ecological
              perspective, their power to differentiate between pure DCIS and
              upstaged DCIS increased significantly. Second, using
              eco-evolutionary guided computational and digital pathology
              techniques, we discovered distinct niches with spatial patterns of
              these biomarkers and used the distribution of such niches to
              predict patient upstaging. The niches patterns were characterized
              by pattern analysis of both cellular and spatial features. With a
              5-fold validation on the biopsy cohort, we trained a random forest
              classifier to achieve the area under curve (AUC) of 0.74. Our
              results affirm the importance of using eco-evolutionary-designed
              approaches in biomarkers discovery studies in the era of digital
              pathology by demonstrating the role of tumor ecological habitats

              normal and neoplastic cells are robust to the mutational stressors
              in the microenvironment to the extent that secure their fitness.
              To test the robustness of genes under a range of mutagens, we
              developed a sequential mutation simulator, Sinabro, to simulate
              single base substitution under a given mutational process. Then,
              we developed a pipeline to measure the robustness of genes and
              cells under those mutagenesis processes. We discovered significant
              human genome robustness to the APOBEC mutational signature SBS2,
              which is associated with viral defense mechanisms and is
              implicated in cancer. Robustness evaluations across over 70,000
              sequences against 41 signatures showed higher resilience under
              signatures predominantly causing C-to-T (G-to-A) mutations.
              Principal component analysis indicates the GC content at the
              codon's wobble position significantly influences robustness, with
              increased resilience noted under transition mutations compared to
              transversions. Then, we tested our results in bats at extremes of
              the lifespan-to-mass relationship and found the long-lived bat is
              more robust to APOBEC than the short-lived one. By revealing
              robustness to APOBEC ranked highest in human (and bats with much
              more than number of APOBEC) genome, this work bolsters the key
              potential role of APOBECs in aging and cancer, as well as evolved

               therapies and immunotherapies offer more options for sequential
               or combined treatments. Nevertheless, mortality in metastatic
               ovarian cancer patients remains high because cancer cells
               consistently develop resistance to single and combination
               therapies, urging a need for treatment designs that target the
               evolvability of cancer cells. The evolutionary dynamics that lead

               and dynamic ways. Conventional therapies for ovarian cancer
               inevitably lead to the development of resistance because they
               fail to consider tumours' heterogeneity and cellular plasticity.
               Eco-evolutionarily designed therapies should consider cancer cell
               plasticity and patient-specific characteristics to improve
               clinical outcome and prevent relapse.",

               pre-malignant cells must adapt to this acidosis to thrive.
               Adaptation to acidosis selects cancer cells that can thrive in
               harsh conditions and are capable of outgrowing the normal or
               non-adapted neighbors. This selection is usually accompanied by
               phenotypic change. Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is one
               of the most important switches correlated to malignant tumor cell
               phenotype and has been shown to be induced by tumor acidosis. New
               evidence shows that the EMT switch is not a binary system and
               occurs on a spectrum of transition states. During confirmation of
               the EMT phenotype, our results demonstrated a partial EMT
               phenotype in our acid-adapted cell population. Using RNA

               cancer genomics, alone, is unable to translate the wealth of
               information into successful cures. While gene sequencing has
               significantly improved our understanding of the natural history
               of cancer and identified candidates for therapeutic targets, it
               cannot predict the impact of the biological response to
               therapies. Hence, patients with a common mutational profile may
               respond differently to the same therapy, due in part to different
               microenvironments impacting on gene regulation. This complexity
               arises from a feedback circuit involving epigenetic modifications

               heterogeneity and evolution as a dynamic interaction among
               subpopulations through the application of small, but selective
               biological forces such as intracellular pH (pHi) and/or
               extracellular pH (pHe) vulnerabilities. Increased glycolysis is a
               prominent phenotype of cancer cells under hypoxia or normoxia
               (Warburg effect). Glycolysis leads to an important aspect of
               cancer metabolism: reduced pHe and higher pHi. We recently showed
               that decreasing pHi and targeting pHi sensitive enzymes can
               reverse the Warburg effect (WE) phenotype and inhibit tumor
               progression. Herein, we used diclofenac (DIC) repurposed to
               control MCT activity, and Koningic acid (KA) that is a GAPDH

               favor of a less aggressive phenotype without a WE to control
               progression and metastasis. In a 3D spheroid co-cultures, we
               showed that our strategy can control the growth of more
               aggressive MDA-MB-231 cells, while sparing the less aggressive

               or sub-clonal populations in favor of slower growth and less

               HIF-α stabilization is typically facultative, induced by hypoxia
               and reduced by normoxia. In some cancers, HIF-α stabilization
               becomes constitutive under normoxia. We develop a mathematical
               model that predicts how fluctuating oxygenation affects HIF-α
               stabilization and impacts net cell proliferation by balancing the
               base growth rate, the proliferative cost of HIF-α expression, and
               the mortality from not expressing HIF-α during hypoxia. We
               compare optimal net cell proliferation rate between facultative
               and constitutive HIF-α regulation in environments with different

               regulation with stochastic or slow periodicity in oxygenation.
               However, cell fitness is nearly identical for both HIF-α

               pseudohypoxia or the “Warburg Effect”. We conclude that rapid and

               dominate the population under normal pH and low glucose
               conditions; and MDA-MB-231 cells, which exhibit high levels of

               cells in low glucose conditions and coexistence is achieved in

               cancer cells adapt to their local microenvironment, and these
               adaptations further modify the environment, inducing more
               changes. From nascent intraductal neoplasms to disseminated
               metastatic disease, several levels of evolutionary adaptations
               and selections occur. Here, we focus on one example of such an
               adaptation mechanism, namely, ``niche construction'' promoted by
               adaptation to acidosis, which is a metabolic adaptation to the
               early harsh environment in intraductal neoplasms. The avascular
               characteristics of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) make the
               periluminal volume profoundly acidic, and cancer cells must adapt
               to this to survive. Based on discovery proteomics, we
               hypothesized that a component of acid adaptation involves
               production of collagen by pre-cancer cells that remodels the
               extracellular matrix (ECM) and stabilizes cells under acid
               stress. The proteomic data were surprising as collagen production
               and deposition are commonly believed to be the responsibility of
               mesenchymally derived fibroblasts, and not cells of epithelial
               origin. Subsequent experiments in 3D culture, spinning disk and
               second harmonic generation microscopy of DCIS lesions in
               patients' samples are concordant. Collagen production assay by
               acid-adapted cells in vitro demonstrated that the mechanism of
               induction involves the RAS and SMAD pathways. Secretome analyses
               show upregulation of ECM remodeling enzymes such as TGM2 and
               LOXL2 that are collagen crosslinkers. These data strongly
               indicate that acidosis in incipient cancers induces collagen
               production by cancer cells and support the hypothesis that this
               adaptation initiates a tumor-permissive microenvironment
               promoting survival and growth of nascent cancers.",

               tumours. Traditionally, invasion is thought to be driven by cells
               that have acquired all the necessary traits to overcome the range
               of biological and physical defences employed by the body.
               However, in light of the ever-increasing evidence for geno- and
               phenotypic intra-tumour heterogeneity, an alternative hypothesis
               presents itself: could invasion be driven by a collection of
               cells with distinct traits that together facilitate the invasion
               process? In this paper, we use a mathematical model to assess the
               feasibility of this hypothesis in the context of acid-mediated
               invasion. We assume tumour expansion is obstructed by stroma
               which inhibits growth and extra-cellular matrix (ECM) which
               blocks cancer cell movement. Further, we assume that there are
               two types of cancer cells: (i) a glycolytic phenotype which
               produces acid that kills stromal cells and (ii) a
               matrix-degrading phenotype that locally remodels the ECM. We
               extend the Gatenby-Gawlinski reaction-diffusion model to derive a
               system of five coupled reaction-diffusion equations to describe
               the resulting invasion process. We characterise the spatially
               homogeneous steady states and carry out a simulation study in one
               spatial dimension to determine how the tumour develops as we vary
               the strength of competition between the two phenotypes. We find
               that overall tumour growth is most extensive when both cell types
               can stably coexist, since this allows the cells to locally mix
               and benefit most from the combination of traits. In contrast,
               when inter-species competition exceeds intra-species competition
               the populations spatially separate and invasion arrests either:
               (i) rapidly (matrix-degraders dominate) or (ii) slowly
               (acid-producers dominate). Overall, our work demonstrates that
               the spatial and ecological relationship between a heterogeneous
               population of tumour cells is a key factor in determining their
               ability to cooperate. Specifically, we predict that tumours in
               which different phenotypes coexist stably are more invasive than
               tumours in which phenotypes are spatially separated.",

               individual-based approaches that neglect population dynamics
               necessity for the global picture of cancer evolution in each
               cancer type. Here, we conducted a population-based study in
               breast cancer to understand the timing of malignancy evolution
               and its correlation to the genetic evolution of pathological
               stages. Results In an omics integrative approach, we integrated
               gene expression and genomic aberration data for pre-invasive
               (DCIS, early-stage) and post-invasive (IDC, late-stage) samples
               and investigated the evolutionary role of further genetic changes
               in late stages compared to the early ones. We found that single
               genetic alterations (SGAs) and copy number alterations (CNAs)
               conspire together for the fine-tuning of the operating signaling
               pathways of tumors in forward and backward evolution manners. The
               forward evolution applies to new genetic changes that boost the
               efficiency of selected signaling pathways. The backward
               evolution, which we detected for CNAs, is a mean to reverse
               unwanted SGAs of earlier stages. Analyses of the integrated point
               mutation and gene expression data show that (i) our proposed
               fine-tuning concept is also applicable in metastasis, and (ii)
               metastasis diverges from primary tumor sometimes at the DCIS
               stage. Conclusions Our results indicate that malignant potency of
               breast tumors is constant over pre and post invasive pathological
               stages. Indeed, further genetic alterations in later stages do
               not establish de novo malignancy routes; however, they serve to
               fine-tune antecedent signaling pathways.",

                 node resident cells from activated immune cells in such close
                 quarters would need to be robust and reversible. Effector
                 functions of T-cells are profoundly and reversibly inhibited by
                 an acidic microenvironment. The underlying mechanisms of this
                 inhibition are unknown, but may relate to glycolysis, which is
                 obligatory for expression of effector functions. Here, we
                 demonstrate that acidification rapidly and potently inhibits
                 monocarboxylate transporter-dependent lactic acid efflux, which

                 site for such modulation. Using multiple imaging techniques, we
                 show that paracortical T-zones of lymph nodes are highly
                 acidic. We further show that T-cells can be activated by
                 dendritic cells at low pH, and their effector functions are
                 restored rapidly upon increasing pH. Thus, we describe a novel
                 physiological mechanism whereby activated T-cells are kept in
                 stasis by acidosis whilst resident in lymph nodes.",

abstract = {It was previously reported that dendrosomes, i.e. neutral, biodegradable, covalent or self-assembled, hyperbranched, spheroidal nano-particles with a size ranging from 15 to 100 nm, provide a convenient and efficient means of gene delivery into various kinds of cells such as human hepatoma and kidney cells as well as animal models. RESULTS: New studies via circular dichroism show that hydrophilic and amphipathic dendrosomes either do not affect the DNA structure or moderately transform it from B- to A-conformation. Gene delivery into human liver, kidney, and endothelial cells as well as other animal cells like Bowes, U-937, Raw, CCRF-CEM, MOLT-4, K562, Huh-7 and VERO reveal that the genes are efficiently expressed and in comparison with other gene porters like Lipofectin or bacterial ghosts, do quite well. It is also shown that dendrosomes are able to deliver genes into cells like endothelials that are usually hard to transfect. Cell culture experiments as well as intraperitoneal/intradermal injections of dendrosomes into mice establish their nontoxicity (up to 2.5 mg kg−1 of animal weight in the latter case). Studies on immunization of BALB/c mice using conventional adjuvants such as aluminium phosphate, CpG motif and one of the dendrosomes, indicate that the latter leads to the mildest initial response development while exceeding them afterwards. CONCLUSION: CD studies reveal that, owing to the neutrality of dendrosomes, formation of Den/DNA complexes is accompanied by slight structural modifications of DNA cell culture, and animal studies reveal that dendrosomes are inert, non-toxic and highly efficient gene porters that perform at extremely low doses. In comparison with bacterial ghosts and some common porters, they are efficient in delivery of genes into animals and a variety of cells including those that are usually hard to transfect.},
