abstract = {The physical interactions that switch the functional state of membrane proteins are poorly understood. Previously, the pH-gating conformations of the β-barrel forming outer membrane protein G (OmpG) from Escherichia coli have been solved. When the pH changes from neutral to acidic the flexible extracellular loop L6 folds into and closes the OmpG pore. Here, we used single-molecule force spectroscopy to structurally localize and quantify the interactions that are associated with the pH-dependent closure. At acidic pH, we detected a pH-dependent interaction at loop L6. This interaction changed the (un)folding of loop L6 and of β-strands 11 and 12, which connect loop L6. All other interactions detected within OmpG were unaffected by changes in pH. These results provide a quantitative and mechanistic explanation of how pH-dependent interactions change the folding of a peptide loop to gate the transmembrane pore. They further demonstrate how the stability of OmpG is optimized so that pH changes modify only those interactions necessary to gate the transmembrane pore.}

abstract = {Abstract We applied dynamic single-molecule force spectroscopy to quantify the parameters (free energy of activation and distance of the transition state from the folded state) characterizing the energy barriers in the unfolding energy landscape of the outer membrane protein G (OmpG) from Escherichia coli. The pH-dependent functional switching of OmpG directs the protein along different regions on the unfolding energy landscape. The two functional states of OmpG take the same unfolding pathway during the sequential unfolding of β-hairpins I–IV. After the initial unfolding events, the unfolding pathways diverge. In the open state, the unfolding of β-hairpin V in one step precedes the unfolding of β-hairpin VI. In the closed state, β-hairpin V and β-strand S11 with a part of extracellular loop L6 unfold cooperatively, and subsequently β-strand S12 unfolds with the remaining loop L6. These two unfolding pathways in the open and closed states join again in the last unfolding step of β-hairpin VII. Also, the conformational change from the open to the closed state witnesses a rigidified extracellular gating loop L6. Thus, a change in the conformational state of OmpG not only bifurcates its unfolding pathways but also tunes its mechanical properties for optimum function.},

abstract = {Abstract BACKGROUND: It was previously reported that dendrosomes, i.e. neutral, biodegradable, covalent or self-assembled, hyperbranched, spheroidal nano-particles with a size ranging from 15 to 100 nm, provide a convenient and efficient means of gene delivery into various kinds of cells such as human hepatoma and kidney cells as well as animal models. RESULTS: New studies via circular dichroism show that hydrophilic and amphipathic dendrosomes either do not affect the DNA structure or moderately transform it from B- to A-conformation. Gene delivery into human liver, kidney, and endothelial cells as well as other animal cells like Bowes, U-937, Raw, CCRF-CEM, MOLT-4, K562, Huh-7 and VERO reveal that the genes are efficiently expressed and in comparison with other gene porters like Lipofectin or bacterial ghosts, do quite well. It is also shown that dendrosomes are able to deliver genes into cells like endothelials that are usually hard to transfect. Cell culture experiments as well as intraperitoneal/intradermal injections of dendrosomes into mice establish their nontoxicity (up to 2.5 mg kg−1 of animal weight in the latter case). Studies on immunization of BALB/c mice using conventional adjuvants such as aluminium phosphate, CpG motif and one of the dendrosomes, indicate that the latter leads to the mildest initial response development while exceeding them afterwards. CONCLUSION: CD studies reveal that, owing to the neutrality of dendrosomes, formation of Den/DNA complexes is accompanied by slight structural modifications of DNA cell culture, and animal studies reveal that dendrosomes are inert, non-toxic and highly efficient gene porters that perform at extremely low doses. In comparison with bacterial ghosts and some common porters, they are efficient in delivery of genes into animals and a variety of cells including those that are usually hard to transfect.
